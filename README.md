Some experiments with shaders in Unity. 

Currently implemented shaders:

1. The argument of the quotient of two complex polynomials. The polynomial coefficients are a pseudorandom function of time. Inspiration: https://twitter.com/keenanisalive/status/1448011475231117315.
2. A noisy ripple effect triggered via mouse clicks. Built upon  the example in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8--5LwHRhjk.
3. A geometry shader for building ribbon geometry for a piecewise-linear curve.
4. A geometry shader for computing stereographic projections from a sphere to the complex plane and vice versa.
